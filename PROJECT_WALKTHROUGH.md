# Portfolio Website Walkthrough

I have successfully **redesigned** your portfolio website with a strict **Black and Orange** theme and refined the content flow.

## Design Updates

### 1. Color Palette (Black & Orange)
- **Background**: Almost pure black (`oklch(0.005 0 0)`).
- **Primary**: Vibrant Orange (`oklch(0.6 0.22 50)`).
- **Typography**: Bold Orange headings for "VISUAL STORYTELLER", "Gallery", and "Book a Session".

### 2. Layout & Flow
- **Landing Page (Hero)**: 
    - Simplified design.
    - Buttons now link explicitly to **#gallery** and **Book Now**.
- **Gallery (Grid)**:
    - Renamed from "Portfolio" to **"Gallery"** to match your terminology.
    - Uses a masonry-style grid to showcase images/videos.
- **Navbar**: Main navigation link is now **"Gallery"**.

## Features (Retained)
- **Booking Page**: Functional form.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-friendly.

## Verification
- **Build**: `npm run build` passed successfully.
- **Flow**: User lands on Hero -> Click "View Gallery" -> Smooth scroll to Gallery Grid.
